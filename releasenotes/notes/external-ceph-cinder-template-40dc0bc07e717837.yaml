    Default behavior for generating cinder.conf template has changed,
    now cinder.conf with rbd-1 section will be generated when external Ceph
    functionality is used i.e. cinder_backend_ceph is set to true.
    Previously it was only included when Kolla-Ansible internal
    Ceph deployment mechanism was used.
